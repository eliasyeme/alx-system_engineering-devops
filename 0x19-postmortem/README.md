# Postmortem: E-commerce Platform Partial Outage
## Issue Summary:
- Duration: 30 minutes (10:15 AM - 10:45 AM PST)
- Impact: 40% of users experienced slow page loading and checkout delays. No complete outages were reported.
- Service: Our e-commerce platform, impacting product browsing, cart management, and order processing.
- Root Cause: Overloaded database server due to a sudden spike in concurrent API calls from a marketing campaign.

## Timeline:
- 10:15 AM: Monitoring alerts signaled increased latency and response times across database servers.
- 10:20 AM: Engineers investigate, initially suspecting increased traffic due to a seasonal sale.
- 10:25 AM: Analysis reveals unusual API call patterns, tracing back to a recently launched email marketing campaign.
- 10:30 AM: The marketing team is notified, and the campaign is temporarily paused.
- 10:35 AM: Database scaling procedures are initiated, including automatic resource allocation and horizontal scaling.
- 10:40 AM: System performance stabilizes, response times return to normal.
- 10:45 AM: All functionality restored, marketing campaign resumes with rate limiting measures.

## Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:
- Initial focus on seasonal traffic surge instead of pinpointing the specific marketing campaign.
- Time wasted investigating potential frontend performance issues before identifying the database bottleneck.

## Resolution:
- Root Cause: The marketing campaign triggered a burst of API calls exceeding the database server's capacity.
- Solution: Scaling the database resources dynamically and implementing rate limiting on the marketing campaign APIs.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Improved Monitoring: Enhance monitoring granularity to detect specific API behavior and resource bottlenecks.
- Campaign Throttling: Implement automated throttling mechanisms for marketing campaigns to prevent overloading.
- Communication Channels: Establish clearer communication channels between marketing and engineering teams for campaign deployment.
- Database Optimization: Evaluate database optimization techniques for improved scalability and performance.

## Lessons Learned:
- Proactive collaboration between marketing and engineering teams is crucial for preventing and mitigating service disruptions.
- Detailed monitoring and analytics are essential for pinpointing the root cause of performance issues quickly.
- Implementing automated scaling and throttling mechanisms can enhance system resilience against unexpected traffic surges.
